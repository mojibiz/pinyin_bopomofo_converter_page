Pinyin to Bopomofo Converter
Welcome to the Pinyin to Bopomofo Converter project! This web application allows users to easily convert Pinyin text with tone marks into Bopomofo, a phonetic system used in Mandarin Chinese.
Features
User-Friendly Interface: Simply enter your Pinyin text in the input area, and click the "Convert to Bopomofo" button to see the results instantly.
Copy to Clipboard: Easily copy the converted Bopomofo text with a single click using the copy button.
Tone Support: The converter accurately handles various tones in Pinyin, ensuring that the output reflects the correct pronunciation.
How It Works
The application utilizes a JavaScript class, PinyinBopomofo, which contains mappings for Pinyin tones, initials, finals, and special syllables. The conversion process involves normalizing the input Pinyin, identifying its components, and then mapping them to their corresponding Bopomofo characters.
